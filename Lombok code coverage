First of all, @Data annotation is the combination of @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter, @Setter.

If you just need Lombok to create getters and setters automatically, you can use only @Getter and @Setter annotations instead of @Data.

Besides, to keep the methods created by Lombok outside of this coverage, you can create a lombok.config file in your root directory and have these two lines:

config.stopBubbling = true
lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true

After adding this line, when you go to Sonar, you will see that these classes are covered 100%
